Week 7 / 05.05.2022

        We have decided that we would get rid of the MapBuilder button since it would be tough for us to create it. I, Gün, and Tarık
    have worked on some GUI elements. I have focused mainly on making and animating all screens gui elements and background images. I have painted most of the buttons (both pressed and normal versions) on paint3D manually.
