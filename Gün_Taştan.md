Week 1 / 03.24.2022

                We have asked to our TA (Sinan Sonlu) about what we should do. He recommended us to use libgdx
        as a game engine so we started to look into it. We also determined which classes we were going to use with
        a group meeting for about 4-5 hours after lab.

Week 2 / 03.31.2022

                We have seperated our work. Tarık and Tuna decided to work on GUI part while Faik, Emre, and Gün
        decided to work on the parameters and algorithms that we were going to use. We again, decided this with a 
        group meeting for about 2 hours.

                Faik and Tarık made a presentation about our group project. Emre, Gün, and Tuna have helped them with
        the slide with their researches this week. Then, Faik and Tarık presented our first project ideas.

Week 3 / 04.07.2022

                We have created our requirements report. 
                Emre looked into libgdx and the features that we'll have to use.
                Tuna worked on the parameters and classes that we would need in our project, using our presentation slides and additions.
                Gün wrote most of the information in the requirements report because of his good language use. 
                Tarık tried to find some 
        other works and games that we were inspired when creating our game. He cited them and explained why we were inspired from them
        in the report. 
                Faik worked on our concerns about our project, problems we were having, and found solutions to them. He also worked with
        every group member after his work is done.

Week 4 / 04.14.2022

        Our group had to study for the midterms this week.

Week 5 / 04.21.2022

                We made a group meeting to decide who will do what and what we were missing in our project.
        accordingly, we have seperated our works with each other. Also, we worked on our next report together.

                Emre created persons in our project and made them infect each other with a collision feature.
                Tarık contributed to Emre's work by fixing some problems with it.
                Gün and Tuna worked on some GUI elements. Found some information about creating some buttons.
                Faik worked with emre with the collision part. Emre and Faik exchanged some information about
        collision and person object.

Week 6 / 04.28.2022

                Tarık used the GUI elements that Tuna and Gün made, and improved some of them. He created our first functional screen.
        we started to work on the main screen as a group.
                Tuna improved and changed some of Tarık's work. He added a functional button in howTo screen, and prepared hand-made 
        images to teach the user how to use the application. He applied them to the main screen.
                Gün, Faik, and Emre worked hardly on the routine implementation and the map. They managed to use a path finding algorithm
        and applied it to the code. They also worked on some bugs which we have faced a lot when having person objects move. Then, all of us
        had a group meeting and we coded together for the whole day after lab. We managed to create an almost completed main menu screen, connected to
        the simulation screen.

Week 7 / 05.05.2022

                Faik and Emre managed to complete the final route implementation and used the algorithm perfectly. They made some test runs and fixed the bugs
        according to their tests. They also worked on the curfew options and implemented a simple version.
                Tuna and Tarık worked together this week. Tuna created special buttons for the application and edited each one of them, while Tarık used them to create
        functional buttons. Tuna also worked on backgrounds and GUI elements while Tarık started to help to Faik & Emre group.
                Gün managed to create the settings screen with a good looking slider, which the others couldn't achieve. He also added our mask features. He coded it
        so that mask would protect people from getting sick. He also added parameters accordingly.

Week 8 / 05.12.2022
                We have gathered three times in total for more than 4 hours each gathering this week. We worked REALLY HARD on fixing some bugs. We implemented timer,
        curfew, mask, buildings, parameters, viruses, algorithms and routines all together. We also completed our detailed design report and graded each other. Also,
        we have made a presentation with our application working fine. We got some feedback from our TA, and made our final implementations.
