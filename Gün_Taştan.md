Week 1 / 03.24.2022

        From now on, we're splitting into two groups to make things go easy and fast. One group will do the coding, the other the user interfaces and screens. Since I am also in the group that makes GUIs, I started to discover what screens are and how to create them in the game engine we use. I started watching videos on Youtube, practical applications from stackOverflow and the course that Emre Akgül (our teammate) bought.

Week 3 / 04.07.2022

                We prepared the Requirements report. The direction of our project has started to take shape gradually. We've clarified the basics. We discussed similar jobs that could and help(Similar works).

Week 4 / 04.14.2022

        I couldn't spare time for the project due to midterm exams. I learned about creating a screen in my spare time to understand what it was practically. (It didn't take my time because it was easy. I didn't work hard for project in this week).

Week 5 / 04.21.2022

        It's been a week that I've had trouble running the project. Even though I downloaded the project file, I couldn't run it because there is a Turkish character ü in my name. Since I was constantly getting the Main not found error, my influence on the project remained intellectual. (We discussed the classes and their methods).I tried to close my gap by watching videos (gui videos from udemy) and reviewing my friends' work.

Week 6 / 04.28.2022

        It's been a busy week when I started coding. I did a lot of research to make up for my lack of programming in the past weeks. First I created my own test project and added new screens. I learned the transition between them by watching videos. I learned how to add basic GUI elements and gain their functionality with a few tries.

Week 7 / 05.05.2022

        In the project, we decided not to do a few things that we planned before. We think we don't have enough time, and we decided not to add the map builder, which did not contribute much to the project.
        I managed to add my first screen to our project. I designed and coded the settings screen. I have added music and sounds. Tarik didn't like my music but okay. Working with my friends (Tarik and Tuna) we improved the interface considerably. The main screen and howTo, Credits, Settings screens are almost done.


Week 8 / 05.12.2022
               I added the mask and vaccination buttons to our simulation screen. Even though it was changed later, I added functionality to the mask. In my version, only a healthy person wearing a mask was not infected ninety percent. Emre and Faik changed this infected group and made it more beautiful. We thought about the logic of vaccination with Emre. We prepared our project for completion and made its presentation. I made a few GUI improvements after the presentation.
