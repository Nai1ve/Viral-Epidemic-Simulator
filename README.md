Built a Java desktop application to examine how measures such as curfews and masks will affect the course of a pandemic using LibGDX framework with my 4 project partners. Developed an algorithm running in the background so individuals can simultaneously report whether they interact with others using the LibGDX framework. Implemented the movements of individuals in the simulation using the Dijkstra’s algorithm.

#### Run our project by running main file DesktopLauncher.java at project\Project\desktop\src\com\mygdx\viralepidemicsim\DesktopLauncher.java

The program was written in Java version 11 and the libGDX game engine developed with the Java programming language was used.
Since our project is programmed with the Java software language, the JVM system file is required to run it.
650 megabytes of RAM is used at maximum while the application is running.
