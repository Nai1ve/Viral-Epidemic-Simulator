Week 1 / 03.24.2022

    classes are determined. We are trying to picture what the program will look like. We are taking notes and creating the most simplistic structure of the program. We are trying to evaluate every idea.

Week 2 / 03.31.2022

    I have made and presented the presentation with Tarık. We are dividing into groups to work more efficiently. A group will be focused on the implementation of the GUI and our group will focus on the coding part.
    Emre Akgül provided us with the needed source, a udemy course, to learn how to code in libGdX. 

Week 3 / 04.07.2022

    We have done the requirements report. The report helped us a lot with making decisions about the program. We also have discussed the games that have features that we want to implement to our program.

Week 4 / 04.14.2022

    This week I spent most of my time studying for the midterm exam. I have watched videos on YouTube to have a more comprehensive understanding of the simulation.

Week 5 / 04.21.2022

    We have designed the classes. And started working on them. I am with Tuna and Gün. They had a problem with libGDX in their computers. After some time we managed to solve the problems. And created the basic version of the map and the buildings.

Week 6 / 04.28.2022

    We are trying to implement the dijkstra and the map with emre. At the same time, there are some issues about memory leak which we are trying to get rid of.

Week 7 / 05.05.2022

    We have decided that we would get rid of the MapBuilder button since it would be tough for us to create it. Emre did some really hard calculations on the map. I have coded all of them and created the GridMap class and the Building Class. Together we also added all the edges. It was a lot of work.

Week 8 / 05.12.2022
    While ending the project we are trying to make it as much presentable as possible while debugging and fixing small glitches all the time. Adding parameters screen was a good call.
