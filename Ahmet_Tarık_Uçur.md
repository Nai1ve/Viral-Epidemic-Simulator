Week 1 / 03.24.2022

        We have managed to think of the classes we probably will need by this point.
    I have committed to our GitHub project and named the classes 
    accordingly. Also, we have decided to use the libgdx (Game engine), so I have 
    created a libgdx project and imported our classes there.

        My primary source for my work was this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUH05KCsDrU.

Week 2 / 03.31.2022

        For this week, we have decided to separate our work. I took the part which mainly focused on
    creating new screens for the application. I've searched a bit to learn how I would make a screen
    with the help of my project friend, "Emre Akg端l". He let us use his udemy account, and we watched 
    some libgdx courses separately. Then, I made a similar screen to the one I saw in the study
    and adjusted it slightly.

        Faik and I made a presentation about our group project. We have worked together to create a slide
    show which also will be beneficial to us for our later plans.

Week 3 / 04.07.2022

        This week, I've mostly worked on the requirements report. I have mainly focused on the games in which we might
    use their game features. I've listed them, talked to our group members, and added them to our requirements report.

Week 4 / 04.14.2022

        I focused on my midterm exams this week, so I couldn't work much on the project. I didn't make any pushes 
    but I watched 2 or 3 different libgdx videos to get the main idea.

Week 5 / 04.21.2022

        I've worked with Emre Akg端l this week. We improved the project a lot, thanks to Emre. He managed to create humans
    who will walk randomly and infect each other. I didn't contribute to his work that much, but I've fixed the PPM problem
    and improved the infection rate.

        Other than that, I've watched more tutorials about buttons and screens and created an opening screen that will be the
    main screen for our game. Only simulation and credits buttons were functionally working for that time.

Week 6 / 04.28.2022

        This week, I have worked on bugs and improvements to my previous works rather than creating new things. Our game would 
    destroy the memory of the computer when clicking the buttons. If you were to press any button 90-100 times, the game would crash
    because of the memory leak. I've fixed that problem and improved the buttons so that they won't be hardcoded as I've done before.
    I've asked for help from Emre Akg端l, and I've created GUI elements accordingly.

Week 7 / 05.05.2022

        We have decided that we would get rid of the MapBuilder button since it would be tough for us to create it. Then,
    I have worked on the music since the previous music was probably too much for a simulation game :D. I, G端n, and Tuna
    have worked on some GUI elements. We gave feedback to each other after creating every screen, so the main screen and
    functions are done except for the simulation and game screens.

Week 8 / 05.12.2022
        I worked on the timer and some curfew options. I managed to fix some of the wrong
    imports and specialized some functional classes. Also, I added some good-looking features to make it more fun to use the application. Then, I fixed most of the bugs
    we had during and after our presentation.
